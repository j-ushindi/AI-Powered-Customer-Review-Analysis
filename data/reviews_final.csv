Why risk it?,"we adopted penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. we decided to switch her from purina pro plan w/ shredded chicken to a premium food. after reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try canidae. my sister feeds canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />we mixed only a little canidae into penny's kibble. my guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. we watched her very closely. within a day, we noticed some changes. first of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. no biggie. she also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). more importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. this continued sporadically for another day and half. it wasn't constant or serious. she didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. still, it was very clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of canidae per day. having read the reviews of canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. we made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />after a lot of research, we decided to try solid gold hund-n-flocken for puppies. we mixed in the solid gold at the same proportions as the canidae. the nibbling stopped immediately. no sneezing, either. her focus seems to have improved as well, though i can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />if you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. indeed, i am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that no food works for all dogs. that said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. who knows why (canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? feel free to try canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. or, better yet, do what i wish i did, and just start with a different brand. there is nothing special about the canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?",2009-02-20,2009,2,2009-02,2537,454,0.845,0.072,0.054,0.874,0.1292720204965103,0.4742481667991872,Positive,Other

Schumacher ""Grey""",0,0,4,1278547200,"Good coffee, but needs a bit of cream","melitta caf&eacute; collection gourmet coffee: hazelnut cr&egrave;me brulee<br /><br />first of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so i give this coffee four out of five stars. if you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then i would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />before i even opened the package, i was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. the smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. cautiously cutting open the container, i put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, i assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />i have to admit that i was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless i approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />one of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. the standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. extra water should be added after it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. never decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />to properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, i decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  i first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. the taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. the hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. never. so i was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup i drank.<br /><br />also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />to my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when i initially opened the bag. i can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />so, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />with the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, i added some cream to my coffee. the result was wonderful. all of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. no more sourness or bitterness. granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup i eagerly look forward to drinking again. five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />next, i turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. the result was passable. it retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. judging purely by this taste test, i would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />next i added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />i should note that i gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />i generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something i'm happy to keep on my shelf. again i wish to note that i am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than i can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- charles maurice de talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />reviewed by brianna<br /><br />footnote from grey: i agree with brianna's review. this coffee is much improved with the addition of cream. however, i got a very noticable hazlenut flavor from the coffee.",2010-07-08,2010,7,2010-07,5471,946,0.9964,0.14,0.081,0.779,0.0689514991181658,0.5276543209876543,Positive,Shipping/Delivery

(we can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />here--before i get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my review of this salsa: it's fantastic.  there are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually hot.  i have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  i have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  i have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  this is not one of those.  it is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer hot!  i love it!<br /><br />an aside: the only other relatively widely available hot salsa that i can think of is mrs. renfro's mango habanero.  i love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  watery thin.  with very few chunks.  the taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />well, not so with this one: the texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  you can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />the one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...carrots?  that's just weird.<br /><br />what's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  no carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and i can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  i suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />you can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  the burn lasts, too.  i find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after i've stopped indulging.<br /><br />if you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  i can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the product.  if you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is five stars.  not four, not three, but five.  save your shipping complaints for the shipper.  it's only fair.",2011-07-27,2011,7,2011-07,3306,556,0.9624,0.107,0.088,0.805,0.0547916666666666,0.582037037037037,Positive,Shipping/Delivery

Leon,20,20,5,1276214400,"I have to say, it is what is cracked up to be.","i've been making and eating rice throughout my entire life of 43 years now.  i've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything i like in my zojirushi and cuckoo rice makers.  recently, i got interested in making authentic spanish paellas.<br /><br />the first thing i discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  real spanish saffron, spanish chorizo, and spanish paprika are rare and expensive items even in los angeles california.  rabbit isn't easy to find either.  nevertheless, i went through with the program and decided to build and authentic paella.  after watching a plethora of youtube videos, pau gasol on local tv, two episodes of tyler's ultimate, and one episode of good eats, i felt i had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />one thing the spaniards stress: you can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure saffron, (2) calisparra bomba from valencia, (3) real smoky-hot paprika from spain, (4) good extra-virgin olive oil.  you also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel paella.  these are quite inexpensive.  i got a fully legit one from valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  i also gathered that i should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />to make a long story short i purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  they called it the rolls royce of rice.  they said it was unbeatable.  i was more than skeptical.  i have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and i've tried a lot of different types.  they're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />according to the poop-sheets, bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. it's hard to overcook.  i've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  all of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  all sources said 3:1 when you use bomba.  bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />to make a long story short, i made my first authentic spanish paella 2 days ago.  it blew my brains out, and i don't say that lightly.  i've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  this was like a revelation from god.  i can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like alton brown, tyler florence, guy fieri, paula dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  it's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />bomba is delicious rice.  i've eaten a lot of rice, but this one is making me forget about the rest.",2010-06-11,2010,6,2010-06,2892,510,0.9922,0.096,0.026,0.878,0.1653814935064935,0.54531037414966,Positive,Taste/Flavor

330358,B005ATVY88,AC5UIM0EA1BNZ,PalFam,4,4,4,1322611200,Good results but contains soy,"i received hill's science diet ideal balance dog food to try as a bzzagent.  i'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my corgi or belgian sheepdog.  i've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  while i currently don't do these activities with my dogs, i still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />when i received my bzzkit, a 4lb bag of hill's science diet, ideal balance dog food, i checked the ingredients.  the first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  i have to admit i paused at the soybean meal.  in my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  i find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  it's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with ""filler"" in the dog community.  i was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when i opened the bag.  he was very anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  he's not a picky eater, so i anticipated he'd like the ideal balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  i slowly, over the course of days, switched him to ideal balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the ideal balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  it may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  he's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  he seems to like it so much that i can even use ideal balance as a training treat.  5 stars for taste.<br /><br />rex has been eating ideal balance for a couple of weeks now.  it's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />his coat is very nice.  it was nice before, and i haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  the ideal balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  we need more time to see the food's long term impact in rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />rex has a tendency to gain weight.  we really have to watch how much he eats.  and ideal balance helps him pack it on!  this means i can feed him less, which means i'm buying less food in the long run.  but i really have to watch his weight.  and it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  the crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  the protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than i'd seek for him.  i might choose a weight control version of ideal balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  a dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  rex's stools on ideal balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  this tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  they could be a little smaller, but not so much that if i wasn't looking for a change that i'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />overall, i give hill's science diet ideal balance dog food 4 stars.  if there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, i could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on rex's condition on the diet.  if you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",2011-11-30,2011,11,2011-11,4060,758,0.9986,0.149,0.033,0.818,0.2119284016636957,0.5517807943690295,Positive,Product Quality

(gosh i hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  anyway, i started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />i didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, i swear!  but for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />however, canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love canidae's taste, they inhale it.  if your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then canidae grain free als is a 5 star dog food.  for my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />the canidae grain-free all life stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  i've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (innova evo turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  so, i've stuck with canidae's grain free als.<br /><br />i've also done a 50/50 mix with the grain free als and the grain free salmon, the furry kids love it.  the salmon variety smells like fish, big surprise, right?  i try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />as i write this, amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  as much as i'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so i buy canidae here on amazon.<br /><br />ingredients:<br />chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin e supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin a supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin b6), vitamin b12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin d3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.",2010-12-09,2010,12,2010-12,5236,896,0.9992,0.166,0.034,0.8,0.08570457654795,0.5261391352957616,Positive,Customer Service

270552,B000FI2VHM,A31YSTICHFYN7O,"CPR ""xfilebuffyfan""",11,11,4,1246579200,Salsa Garden Seed Kit... More Work than the Herb Kit,"i purchased the aerogarden system and a few kits last year.  on jan 1st 2009 i took out the remnants of the herb kit and planted the salsa garden kit.  this particular kit has several extra steps - plant selection, pruning, growth stabilization, and pollinating.  i will mention each in detail here to help others.  the herb gardens are the easiest - just cut off what you need as you go, once mastered you might find yourself wanting to try something else.  salsa garden and other kits like this - i.e. chili pepper, cherry tomato, snow peas, green beans, etc. - will require a few more steps.  these steps are the main changes for salsa kit vs herb kit.<br /><br />1. plant selection -  with the salsa garden, you must first make a selection of the plants themselves.  after several days of growth you will see the small sprouts.  there will most likely be more than one sprout in each pod - you must cut back to just one plant per pod.  there will be only 3 pods total in this kit - 1 pepper, 2 tomato.  there will be spacers to fill in the other pod slots, this will allow growth of these plants.  plant selection is important, so make sure not to let those extra sprouts keep growing - doing so will eventually overrun your pod space.<br /><br />2. pruning - this kit's instruction uses the 5th branch system.  read that section carefully before your first pruning.  then afterwards you will continue to prune throughout the life of the plant - to prevent growth to close to the lightbulbs and to trim wandering branches that are unable to reach the light.  eventually those branches will die and you can cut them afterwards if you accidently forget to prune them earlier.  you will continually get dead leaves, especially near the base of the plant - do not fret, this will happen a lot as the outer edge of the plant gets more of the light.<br /><br />3. growth stabilization - this kit will eventually require a string or twine, etc.  after your plant grows big enough, the weight of the plant will eventually cause it to begin leaning over, especially after fruit / vegetables begin to appear.  each plant will need a string to stabilize it to the light post at the back of the aerogarden.  i personally used 3 nylon strings that i removed from a shopping mall bag's handle, similar to that of an athletic short's draw string.  you can also get twine or other thick strings, like yarn, from almost any hardware store, crafts store or supermarket.  some other sets like green bean kits have their own support devices, but for the salsa kit you must provide your own - so be prepared.<br /><br />4. pollinating - this might be the easiest step... or possibly not.  as each plant begins to flower, pollination by bees or insects will not be likely.  as per the instructions, you must gently shake the plants to cause the pollen to move about and eventually end up on one of the other flowers.  read this section carefully about how vigorously you should or should not shake the plants - in my oppinion, not very much if at all.  i tried this step and it worked fine for the tomatoes, but not the peppers.  after several waves of blooms appeared on the mini jalapeno plant still no amount of shaking worked.  eventually i tried to shake a little harder, which didn't work and also caused many of the under leaves to fall off.  my advice - use a feather.  this isn't the most practical method, but it works.  when you see several blooms open at once, lightly brush the interior of the first flower - then the second, third, etc.  do not forget to come back and brush the first flower again at the end of the cycle.  the pollen will stick to the feather then stick back onto a different flower - similar to the hairs on an insect's legs and body.  you may have trouble finding a feather - which i recommend using a very clean one at that.  do not grab a feather from a your yard that came from a wild bird or from a farm animal.  you sure don't want lice or other problems in your house.  try a crafts store or you can pull the feather out of a cheap household duster.<br /><br />my final opinion, the tomatoes grow easily and without much trouble except for the stabilization.  the peppers on the other hand stabilize well enough and keep themselves fairly self pruned at the base, but pollinating these bad boys can be a little bit of a trick at first.  overall this was a fun kit and it produced all the way until the end, eventually i ran out of nutrients and decided to remove the plants.  if i hadn't, they'd be still going.  i got about 5 months of produce - which over time was a lot, but i only got 2 or 3 tomatoes at a time or 1 pepper at a time for lots of those weeks in between.  this was fun, but may not be for everyone.  if you mastered the herb kit, then this would be an interesting next step.  on the other hand if you had trouble with the herb kit, then you might want to pass on the salsa kit.",2009-07-03,2009,7,2009-07,4917,912,0.9904,0.088,0.039,0.873,0.0596603927986906,0.4602832333151483,Positive,Customer Service

(overall they seem fairly clean, but i bit into a few grains of sand the first few times i used them because of skipping this step)<br /><br />anyway, this is a fantastic price and a great way to try these varieties if you never have since most aren't available in a lot of grocery stores.  my palate is inexperienced in most of these varieties but they seem good to me...nice big mushrooms that rehydrate well and are full of flavor.<br /><br />finally, i did separately order a variety of other products from earthy direct from their website.  they have a lot of stuff there (sauces, spices, gourmet treats) and their other products are fantastic thus far as well.  watch prices though...although it's nice to get all your little treats in one place, some items really are cheaper here on amazon.<br /><br />customer service from earthy is great as well...i would assume they'd treat amazon orders as well as they treat their direct traffic.  i had an issue (my fault) with an order from their website and they were incredibly helpful fixing it.",2011-12-04,2011,12,2011-12,2021,358,0.9981,0.209,0.011,0.78,0.2701923076923077,0.5326923076923076,Positive,Shipping/Delivery

410247,B000084EZ4,AIDL4DGVARK25,zooz,5,5,5,1298592000,Objective & Subjective (from a particular buyer),"this review is for the 24 pack of 3 oz. cans of the wellness brand cat food.<br /><br />objectively speaking...<br />the cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  there are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  that's all i can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />subjectively speaking...<br />i could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  my cats are 15 and 16 years old.  they are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  i had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  i took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  the vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  after a conversation with a friend in dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  i decided to do some research and was i glad that i did.  my cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes i've noticed.  my cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and i think that was because he was biting at some straw that i didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like i just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  and although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones i'd find in the house.  they have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but i've been told (and now i feel i can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  actual cat food like the wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  i must say that i felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />i will note that i also use the wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  this is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case i am in a situation where i cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  for your reference i feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  i am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, i'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />and as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when i leave it out but they do not finish it all.  i do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months i have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  the longest i've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />i hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  there are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  i've checked and tried a few.  this one is really different.  there are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.  be good to yourself and your pets!",2011-02-25,2011,2,2011-02,4310,831,0.9896,0.08,0.036,0.884,0.0943386243386243,0.4425245653817085,Positive,Shipping/Delivery

""-- M.""",8,8,5,1315612800,Great cat food,"my old cat who died last year had diabetes because i didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition.  after he was diagnosed, i switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />although i would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, i didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and i got another cat.  the old cat would eat anything.  the new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food.  he doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if i even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat.  that's why i was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />first of all, i love the ingredient list.  the foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives.  the only ingredient i'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources i really don't worry about it.  when i was first considering this brand, i checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione.  i looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin k which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin k and it's required for health.  the controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses.  fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that i'm totally comfortable with its inclusion.  (and since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since i think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite.  i was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion.  since i rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, i'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients.  no by-products here!  it even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />but the best part: the cat loves it.  he doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it.  i've tried every single flavor of the ""in gravy"" flavors (i haven't tried the ""in gelee"" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />seriously, it doesn't get any better than this.  there's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it.  there are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition.  i'm sold!",2011-09-10,2011,9,2011-09,3123,530,0.9922,0.135,0.07,0.796,0.143614506408624,0.489543267190326,Positive,Taste/Flavor
